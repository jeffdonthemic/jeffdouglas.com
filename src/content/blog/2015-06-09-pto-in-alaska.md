I left a couple of weeks ago on a month long family vacation in Alaska. Unfortunately I'm too busy riding moose, visiting glaciers, ziplining through forests, hiking mountains and generally doing Alaska stuff to post on my blog or reply to comments. I apologize for the inconvenience but <strong>I'm in Alaska!!!</strong>

If you are interested, you can check out our <a href="http://whereintheworldis.jeffdouglas.com">family travel blog</a> or view a map of <a href="http://www.jeffdouglas.com/map">where we've been</a> or the <a href="http://whereintheworldis.jeffdouglas.com/map/">places we've visited</a>.

I'll be returning to work the last week of June so if you don't hear from me, just assume that I've been eaten by a bear.
