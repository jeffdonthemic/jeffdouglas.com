title:  Setting Up Continuous Integration for Saleforce Development
description: Continuous Integration (CI) for Force.com projects has been a popular topic lately. There are a number of blog post that describe the benefits and how you should go about doing it. However, after we discussed it on our #DifferentSpokes podcast last week, we received a number of emails asking for help on getting CI up and running. So I put together a short video on the process using Jenkins. Here are the links that I reference in the video-  Force.com Migration Tool  Cloudbees  Sample Github repo
