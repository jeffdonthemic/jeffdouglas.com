title:  A Big, Scalable Bucked of RIA Goodness
description: I was thinking about writing this tutorial  but it looks like someone has already beat me to it. This is a really good example of using Flex, BlazeDS and Eclipse with Google App Engine for Java for a highly scalable interface. He even references the GAE/J hack for Adobe BlazeDS to run. Nice work!

He even references the GAE/J <a href="http://martinzoldano.blogspot.com/2009/04/appengine-adobe-blazeds-fix.html" target="_blank">hack for Adobe BlazeDS</a> to run.

Nice work!
