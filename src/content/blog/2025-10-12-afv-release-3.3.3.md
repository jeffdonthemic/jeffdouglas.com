Agentforce Vibes 3.3.0 introduces Deep Planning and Focus Chain—two powerful new tools designed to bring architectural foresight and structured task tracking to your development workflow. Along with enhancements to MCP integration, this release focuses on helping developers manage complex changes with detailed blueprints, dynamic to-do lists, and smarter progress visibility.

### 🧠 Deep Planning

The new `/deep-planning` command transforms Agentforce into a thoughtful architect that deeply plans before it builds. When you run it, Agentforce investigates your codebase, asks clarifying questions, and generates a detailed implementation plan, complete with file paths, class structures, and step-by-step execution order.

It's great for complex work like refactoring, adding cross-cutting features, or coordinating multi-layer changes. Deep Planning helps you stay in control, while Agentforce handles the research, analysis, and blueprinting, so every change starts with a clear plan.

### ✅ Focus Chain

Focus Chain brings structure and visibility to your tasks. It automatically generates and tracks to-do lists as Agentforce works, displaying real-time progress right in the header. Each step updates dynamically as tasks are completed, and you can edit the list at any time.

It also includes a Smart Reminder System to help keep Agentforce's work on track:
- A configurable task reminder interval
- Automatic reminders when switching from Plan Mode to Act Mode
- Optional manual reminders when to-do lists are edited

Together, Deep Planning and Focus Chain make long-horizon development easier to manage and keep your work organized from initial design to final commit.

### 🔧 Improved MCP Integration

We improved the auto-approve performance for MCP server reconnections and enhanced the enablement interface.

Agentforce Vibes 3.3.0 gives developers the tools to plan smarter, track progress effortlessly, and stay focused from concept to completion.
