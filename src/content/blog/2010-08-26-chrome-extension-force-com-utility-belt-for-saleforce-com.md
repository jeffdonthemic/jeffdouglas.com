title:  Chrome Extension - Force.com Utility Belt for Saleforce.com
description: I built the Chrome Extension Salesforce.com ID Converter last month and found it quite useful. I consistently need to check out the Salesforce.com developer guides (especially Apex and Visualforce) so I started on another extension to make my development tasks easier, the Force.com Utility Belt. The extension quickly grew in functionality so I thought I would ask other developers and admins for suggestions on how to make it more useful. It currently has the following features- * Quick reference

The extension quickly grew in functionality so I thought I would ask other developers and admins for suggestions on how to make it more useful. It currently has the following features:

<ul>
<li>Quick reference for Apex, Visualforce and Visualforce components</li>
<li>Converts 15 digit Salesforce IDs to 18 digit IDs</li>
<li>Quick link to open the Salesforce.com developer documentation page.</li>
</ul>
I hope to make the extension public soon but want to make some improvements first. I'm thinking about adding some sort of search functionality but how would you improve this extension? <strong><em>What features would you like to see?</em></strong>
